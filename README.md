# Horiseon-Refactor
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

During this challenge the goal was to not change, but optimize the code to make the 
the HTML and CSS doccuments easier to use. This including grouping together elements in the 
CSS sheet that were calling for the same color, backround color, font sizes, and font color to be applied.
This resulted in having less lines of code on your css sheet. 
For the HTML doccument, the goal was to change all the divs to followm the proper classifications they
were being represented on the webpage. That meant changing it was broken upm by header, section, aside, and footer.
While completing all of these tasks to both HTML and CSS all without having the webpage change when accesing it on a browser.
